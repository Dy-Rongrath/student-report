# 🔧 Fixed: Redirect Loop Issue

## ✅ Problem Solved!

**Issue:** "This page isn't working - redirected you too many times"

**Cause:** NextAuth.js redirect loop due to dynamic Vercel deployment URLs

**Solution:** Configured `AUTH_TRUST_HOST` and `useSecureCookies`

---

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### 1. Removed NEXTAUTH_URL
- Removed the hardcoded `NEXTAUTH_URL` environment variable
- Vercel generates new URLs for each deployment
- NextAuth now auto-detects the current URL

### 2. Added AUTH_TRUST_HOST
Added to all environments (Production, Preview, Development):
```
AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true
```

This tells NextAuth to trust the host header from Vercel.

### 3. Updated auth.ts Configuration
```typescript
useSecureCookies: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
```

This ensures cookies work correctly in production (HTTPS).

## 🌐 New Production URL

**Latest Deployment:**
https://student-report-ob5i66v2q-rongraths-projects.vercel.app

**Status:** ✅ Working (no redirect loop!)

---

## 📊 Current Environment Variables

```bash
npx vercel env ls
```

Result:
```
✅ DATABASE_URL      → Encrypted (All environments)
✅ NEXTAUTH_SECRET   → Encrypted (All environments)
✅ AUTH_TRUST_HOST   → Encrypted (All environments)
❌ NEXTAUTH_URL      → Removed (not needed)
```

## 🧪 Test Your App Now

### 1. Visit Home Page
```
https://student-report-ob5i66v2q-rongraths-projects.vercel.app
```
✅ Should load without redirect loop

### 2. Test Sign In
```
https://student-report-ob5i66v2q-rongraths-projects.vercel.app/auth/signin
```
Credentials:
- Email: `admin@example.com`
- Password: `admin123`

✅ Should sign in and redirect to dashboard

### 3. Access Dashboard
After signing in:
```
/dashboard - Dashboard overview
/students - List of students  
/reports - List of reports
```

## 🔄 Why Did This Happen?

### Vercel's Dynamic URLs
Vercel generates a new URL for each deployment:
- `student-report-itmis6r74-...` (1st deploy)
- `student-report-7b6q2nebr-...` (2nd deploy)
- `student-report-gv25umfk4-...` (3rd deploy)
- `student-report-ob5i66v2q-...` (current)

### The Problem
When `NEXTAUTH_URL` was hardcoded to an old URL, NextAuth would:
1. Try to redirect to the old URL
2. Vercel would redirect to the new URL
3. NextAuth would try the old URL again
4. **Infinite redirect loop!** 🔄

### The Solution
- Remove `NEXTAUTH_URL` → Let NextAuth auto-detect
- Add `AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true` → Trust Vercel's host header
- Add `useSecureCookies` → Ensure HTTPS cookies work

## 🎯 Best Practices for Vercel + NextAuth

### Option 1: Use Custom Domain (Recommended)
Add a custom domain in Vercel:
1. Go to: Project Settings → Domains
2. Add domain: `yourdomain.com`
3. Configure DNS
4. URL stays stable forever!

### Option 2: Use AUTH_TRUST_HOST (Current Solution)
✅ Works with dynamic Vercel URLs  
✅ No custom domain needed  
✅ Automatically adapts to new deployments

### Option 3: Use Vercel's Default Domain
Vercel provides: `student-report.vercel.app`  
- This URL is stable
- Can be used as NEXTAUTH_URL
- But requires project name to be unique globally

## 📝 Changes Made

### File: `src/lib/auth.ts`
```typescript
// Before
export const authOptions: NextAuthOptions = {
  // ... other config
  secret: process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET,
};

// After
export const authOptions: NextAuthOptions = {
  // ... other config
  useSecureCookies: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
  secret: process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET,
};
```

### Environment Variables (Vercel)
```bash
# Added
AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true (Production, Preview, Development)

# Removed  
NEXTAUTH_URL (was causing redirect loop)
```

---

## ✅ Verification Steps

### 1. Check Environment Variables
```bash
npx vercel env ls
```
Should show:
- ✅ DATABASE_URL
- ✅ NEXTAUTH_SECRET
- ✅ AUTH_TRUST_HOST
- ❌ NEXTAUTH_URL (removed)

### 2. Test Home Page
```bash
curl -I https://student-report-ob5i66v2q-rongraths-projects.vercel.app
```
Should return: `200 OK` (not 307/308 redirect loop)

### 3. Test Sign In
- Visit `/auth/signin`
- Enter credentials
- Should redirect to `/dashboard` (not loop)

## 🚨 If You Still See Issues

### Clear Browser Cache
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### Check Cookies
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application → Cookies
3. Clear all cookies for the site
4. Try again

### Verify Environment Variables
```bash
npx vercel env pull .env.production
cat .env.production
```

Should include `AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true`
