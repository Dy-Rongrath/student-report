## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### Next Monday (October 7, 2025)
When Dependabot creates PRs at 6:00 AM UTC:

**Scenario 1: Patch Update**
```
PR: Update @types/react-dom to 19.2.1
Type: version-update:semver-patch
```
→ 🤖 Auto-merge enabled  
→ ⏳ Waits for CI checks (2-3 minutes)  
→ ✅ Auto-merged  
→ 🔔 You get notification: "Merged automatically"

**Scenario 2: Major Update**
```
PR: Update next to 16.0.0
Type: version-update:semver-major
```
→ ⚠️ Manual review required  
→ 💬 Bot comments with review checklist  
→ 🔍 You review when ready  
→ ✅ You merge manually after testing

---

## 📊 Statistics (Projected)

Based on your current dependencies:

**Weekly Dependabot PRs:** ~3-5 PRs  
**Auto-merged:** ~60-80% (2-4 PRs)  
**Manual review:** ~20-40% (1-2 PRs)  
**Time saved:** ~15 minutes per week

## 🔧 Required GitHub Settings

The workflow is now active, but you need to enable these in GitHub UI:

### 1. Enable Auto-Merge Feature
**Location:** Settings → General → Pull Requests

☑️ Allow auto-merge

**Status:** ⚠️ REQUIRES MANUAL ACTION

### 2. Workflow Permissions
**Location:** Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions

☑️ Read and write permissions  
☑️ Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests

**Status:** ⚠️ CHECK IF ENABLED (may be default)

### 3. Branch Protection (Optional but Recommended)
**Location:** Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules

For `main` branch:
- ☑️ Require status checks to pass before merging
  - ✅ CI/CD Workflow
  - ✅ CodeQL Analysis
- ☑️ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- ☑️ Allow deletions (for Dependabot branches after merge)

**Status:** 📋 OPTIONAL (workflow works without this)

```bash
# Create a test branch
git checkout -b test-auto-merge
git commit --allow-empty -m "test: trigger auto-merge"
git push origin test-auto-merge

gh pr create --title "Test: Auto-merge workflow" --body "Testing workflow"
```
