## 📅 What Happens Next

### **Monday, October 7, 2025 (6:00 AM UTC)**

**Dependabot runs automatically:**
1. Scans all dependencies for updates
2. Creates 3-5 pull requests (estimated)
3. Groups related updates together

**Your bot springs into action:**
1. Analyzes each PR within seconds
2. Determines if it's safe to auto-merge
3. Adds comments explaining the decision

**Safe PRs (60-80%):**
- 🤖 Auto-merge enabled immediately
- ⏳ Waits for CI checks to pass (2-3 minutes)
- ✅ Merged automatically
- 📧 Email: "Pull request #X was merged"

**Risky PRs (20-40%):**
- ⚠️ Comment added: "Manual review required"
- 📋 Includes review checklist
- 🔍 You review when you have time
- ✅ You merge manually after testing

---

## 📊 Expected Results

### Week 1 (October 7-13)
- **Dependabot PRs:** 3-5 PRs
- **Auto-merged:** 2-4 PRs (patches, devDeps, GH Actions)
- **Manual review:** 1-2 PRs (if major updates available)
- **Your time saved:** ~10-15 minutes

### Ongoing (Weekly)
- **Average PRs:** 3-5 per week
- **Auto-merged:** 60-80%
- **Manual review:** 20-40%
- **Time saved:** ~15 minutes per week
- **Security patches:** Applied within hours instead of days

   ```
   https://github.com/Dy-Rongrath/student-report/pulls
   ```
   - See which PRs were auto-merged
   - Review any PRs waiting for you

2. **Check Actions Logs:**
   ```
   https://github.com/Dy-Rongrath/student-report/actions
   ```
   - Verify workflow ran successfully
   - Check which PRs were analyzed

3. **Test Deployed App (if auto-merged):**
   ```
   https://student-report-ruby.vercel.app
   ```
   - Verify everything still works
   - Check login, student list, reports

### Monthly (Best Practice)
Review dependency update trends:
- How many PRs were created?

git log --oneline -10

# Revert it
git revert <COMMIT_SHA>
git push origin main
```

**Step 2: Disable auto-merge workflow**
```
Go to: https://github.com/Dy-Rongrath/student-report/actions
Click: "Auto-merge Dependabot PRs" → "•••" → "Disable workflow"
```

**Step 3: Rollback Vercel deployment**
```
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/rongraths-projects/student-report
2. Click "Deployments" tab
3. Find previous working deployment
4. Click "•••" → "Promote to Production"
```

### If Bot is Merging Wrong PRs

**Investigate:**
```bash
# Check workflow logic
cat .github/workflows/auto-merge-dependabot.yml | grep -A 20 "should-merge"

# Check recent auto-merged PRs
# Visit: https://github.com/Dy-Rongrath/student-report/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged
```

**Fix:**
Edit `.github/workflows/auto-merge-dependabot.yml` and adjust the decision logic at lines 35-66.
