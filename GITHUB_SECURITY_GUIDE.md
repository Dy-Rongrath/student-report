## üìç Accessing Security Tab

**URL:** https://github.com/Dy-Rongrath/student-report/security

**Navigation:** Repository ‚Üí **Security** tab (top menu)

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features Overview

### 1. Security Overview Dashboard
Central hub showing all security alerts and status

### 2. Security Policy (SECURITY.md)
‚úÖ **Already Created!** - Document for reporting vulnerabilities

### 3. Security Advisories
Create private security advisories for vulnerabilities

### 4. Dependabot
Automated dependency updates and vulnerability alerts

### 5. Code Scanning (CodeQL)
‚úÖ **Already Configured!** - Automated code analysis

### 6. Secret Scanning

---

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Enable Dependabot Alerts

1. Go to: https://github.com/Dy-Rongrath/student-report/settings/security_analysis

2. Under **Dependabot alerts**:
   - ‚úÖ Enable "Dependabot alerts"
   - ‚úÖ Enable "Dependabot security updates"

3. Under **Dependabot version updates**:
   - Click "Enable"
   - This will auto-create PRs for dependency updates

**What it does:**
- Scans `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
- Alerts you to vulnerable dependencies
- Creates automated PRs to update them

### Step 2: Enable Code Scanning

‚úÖ **Already done!** - We created `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`

**To verify:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/Dy-Rongrath/student-report/security/code-scanning

2. After next push, CodeQL will run and show results

**What it does:**
- Scans code for security vulnerabilities
- Runs on every push and PR
- Weekly scheduled scans
- Detects: SQL injection, XSS, code injection, etc.

### Step 3: Enable Secret Scanning

1. Go to: https://github.com/Dy-Rongrath/student-report/settings/security_analysis

2. Under **Secret scanning**:
   - ‚úÖ Enable "Secret scanning"
   - ‚úÖ Enable "Push protection" (prevents pushing secrets)

**What it does:**
- Scans for API keys, tokens, passwords
- Blocks commits containing secrets
- Alerts you to exposed secrets

### Step 4: Configure Security Policy

‚úÖ **Already created!** - `SECURITY.md` file

**To view:**
https://github.com/Dy-Rongrath/student-report/security/policy

**What it includes:**
- How to report vulnerabilities
- Response timeline
- Security best practices
- Contact information

### Step 5: Set Up Private Vulnerability Reporting

1. Go to: https://github.com/Dy-Rongrath/student-report/settings/security_analysis

2. Under **Private vulnerability reporting**:
   - ‚úÖ Enable "Allow private vulnerability reporting"

**What it does:**
- Users can privately report security issues
- Create draft security advisories
- Coordinate fixes before public disclosure
