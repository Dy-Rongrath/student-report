## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the Student Report System seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to:

**Email:** security@example.com (or your actual email)

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### What to Expect

After submitting a vulnerability report, you can expect:

1. **Acknowledgment:** We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
2. **Investigation:** We'll investigate and validate the issue
3. **Updates:** We'll keep you informed of the progress
4. **Resolution:** We'll work on a fix and release it
5. **Credit:** We'll credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Our Commitment

- We will respond to your report within 48 hours with our evaluation and expected resolution date
- We will handle your report with strict confidentiality
- We will keep you informed of the progress towards resolving the problem
- We will credit you as the discoverer of the vulnerability (unless you prefer otherwise)

## Security Best Practices for Users

### For Administrators

1. **Change Default Credentials**
   - Change the default admin password immediately after installation
   - Use strong passwords (minimum 12 characters, mix of letters, numbers, symbols)

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit `.env` files to version control
   - Rotate secrets regularly (every 90 days recommended)
   - Use different credentials for development and production

3. **Database Security**
   - Use strong database passwords
   - Restrict database access by IP address
   - Enable SSL/TLS for database connections
   - Regular backups with encryption

4. **Session Security**
   - Configure appropriate session timeout (30-60 minutes)
   - Use secure session cookies (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)
   - Regularly clear old sessions

5. **Access Control**
   - Follow principle of least privilege
   - Regular audit of user permissions
   - Remove inactive user accounts
   - Enable two-factor authentication when available

### For Developers

1. **Dependencies**
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Review Dependabot alerts
   - Use `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities
   - Pin dependency versions in production

2. **Code Security**
   - Never commit secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data
   - Sanitize user inputs
   - Use parameterized queries (Prisma handles this)
   - Implement proper error handling

3. **Authentication**
   - Use bcrypt for password hashing (already implemented)
   - Implement rate limiting for login attempts
   - Validate session tokens properly
   - Use HTTPS in production

4. **API Security**
   - Always validate input
   - Implement proper authentication
   - Use CORS appropriately
   - Rate limit API endpoints

## Security Updates

We will announce security updates through:
- GitHub Security Advisories
- Repository README
- Email notifications to maintainers

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Implementation

✅ **Implemented:**
- Password hashing with bcrypt (10 rounds)
- JWT session tokens (NextAuth.js)
- SQL injection prevention (Prisma ORM)
- XSS protection (React automatic escaping)
- CSRF protection (NextAuth.js built-in)
- HTTPS in production (Vercel)
- Environment variable isolation

⚠️ **Recommendations:**
- Implement rate limiting on API routes
- Add two-factor authentication
- Implement account lockout after failed login attempts
- Add email verification for new accounts
- Implement audit logging for sensitive operations
- Add CAPTCHA for registration

## Compliance

This project follows security best practices from:
- OWASP Top 10
- CWE/SANS Top 25
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
