## ⚠️ GitHub Actions Warnings (Not Critical)

### What You See:
```
⚠️ Context access might be invalid: DATABASE_URL
⚠️ Context access might be invalid: NEXTAUTH_SECRET
⚠️ Context access might be invalid: NEXTAUTH_URL
```

### Why This Happens:
- VS Code/Editor checks if GitHub Secrets exist
- Secrets haven't been added to GitHub yet
- **This is NORMAL and expected!**

### Impact:
- ❌ CI/CD pipeline won't run on GitHub Actions
- ✅ Your app still works perfectly on Vercel
- ✅ Manual deployments work fine

### To Fix (Optional):
Follow the guide: **GITHUB_SECRETS_GUIDE.md**

Add 3 secrets to: https://github.com/Dy-Rongrath/student-report/settings/secrets/actions
