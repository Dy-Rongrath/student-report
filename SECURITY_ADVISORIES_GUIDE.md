# 🔒 GitHub Security Advisories - Complete Guide

**Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Repository:** student-report  
**Status:** Available but not yet configured  

---

## 📖 What are Security Advisories?

**GitHub Security Advisories** allow you to:
1. **Privately discuss** security vulnerabilities in your code
2. **Create CVEs** (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) for your project
3. **Coordinate fixes** before public disclosure
4. **Publish security patches** responsibly

---

## 🎯 Two Types of Security Advisories

### 1. **Repository Security Advisories** (What YOU Create)
**Use when:** You discover a security vulnerability in **your own code**

**Example scenarios:**
- ❌ SQL injection vulnerability in your API routes
- ❌ Authentication bypass in your NextAuth configuration
- ❌ XSS vulnerability in student/report rendering
- ❌ Exposed sensitive data in API responses

**Process:**
1. Create private advisory (only you and collaborators see it)
2. Work on fix in private fork
3. Request CVE ID from GitHub (optional)
4. Publish advisory with fix
5. GitHub notifies users of your project

### 2. **Dependabot Security Advisories** (What YOU Receive)
**Use when:** GitHub/Dependabot finds vulnerabilities in **your dependencies**

**Already configured! ✅** This is what you enabled earlier:
- Dependabot scans your dependencies
- Creates alerts for known CVEs
- Automatically creates PRs to fix vulnerabilities
- Your auto-merge bot can handle security patches automatically

---

## 🔍 Current Status of Your Project

### Vulnerabilities Detected by Dependabot

Based on your recent `npm audit`:
```
Found 14 vulnerabilities (3 low, 7 moderate, 4 high)

Affected packages:
- cookie (<0.7.0) - 3 vulnerabilities
- esbuild (<=0.24.2) - 3 vulnerabilities  
- path-to-regexp (4.0.0-6.2.2) - 3 vulnerabilities
- undici (<=5.28.5) - 5 vulnerabilities

All in devDependencies (vercel CLI)
```

**Good news:** These are in `devDependencies` only (not production code)

**Current handling:**
- ✅ Dependabot monitoring these
- ✅ Will create PRs when patches available
- ✅ Auto-merge bot will handle patch updates automatically
- ⏳ Waiting for vercel to update CLI

## 🚀 Enable Security Advisories (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Enable Private Vulnerability Reporting

**What it does:** Allows security researchers to privately report vulnerabilities to you

**How to enable:**
```
1. Go to: https://github.com/Dy-Rongrath/student-report/settings/security_analysis
2. Scroll to "Private vulnerability reporting"
3. Click: "Enable" button
4. Done! ✅
```

**Benefits:**
- Researchers can report issues privately (not public issues)
- You get 90 days to fix before disclosure
- Professional vulnerability management

### Step 2: View Dependabot Alerts

**Check current security alerts:**
```
1. Go to: https://github.com/Dy-Rongrath/student-report/security/dependabot
2. See all 4 currently detected vulnerabilities
3. Review details and affected code
```

**What you'll see:**
- List of vulnerable packages
- Severity level (Low/Moderate/High/Critical)
- Which files are affected
- Available fixes (if any)
- Dependabot PRs (when available)

### Step 3: Review Security Overview

**Dashboard for all security issues:**
```
1. Go to: https://github.com/Dy-Rongrath/student-report/security
2. See overview:
   - 4 Dependabot alerts
   - 0 Code scanning alerts (CodeQL)
   - 0 Secret scanning alerts
```

## 📝 How to Create Your Own Security Advisory

**If you discover a vulnerability in YOUR code:**

### Step 1: Create Private Advisory
```
1. Go to: https://github.com/Dy-Rongrath/student-report/security/advisories
2. Click: "New draft security advisory"
3. Fill in details:
   - Title: Clear description (e.g., "SQL Injection in Report API")
   - Severity: Low/Moderate/High/Critical
   - Description: Detailed explanation
   - Affected versions: Which versions have the bug
   - Patched versions: Which version fixes it
```

### Step 2: Work on Fix Privately
```
1. GitHub creates private fork automatically
2. Fix the vulnerability in private
3. Test thoroughly
4. Commit fix to private fork
```

### Step 3: Request CVE (Optional)
```
1. In advisory, click "Request CVE ID"
2. GitHub assigns official CVE number
3. Adds credibility and tracking
```

### Step 4: Publish Advisory
```
1. Click "Publish advisory"
2. GitHub notifies:
   - Repository watchers
   - Dependabot users (if they depend on your project)
   - Security researchers
3. Vulnerability becomes public
```

## 🎯 Security Advisories vs Dependabot Alerts

| Feature | Your Advisories | Dependabot Alerts |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Purpose** | Vulnerabilities in YOUR code | Vulnerabilities in DEPENDENCIES |
| **Created by** | You (the maintainer) | GitHub/Dependabot automatically |
| **Visibility** | Private until you publish | Private to you, visible in Security tab |
| **Fix process** | You write the fix | Dependabot creates PR with fix |
| **Your project** | Not needed (yet) | ✅ Already active (4 alerts) |

---

## 🔐 Security Advisories for Your Project

### Do You Need to Create Advisories?

**Current assessment:** Probably not yet ❌

**When to create advisories:**
- ✅ Your project is used by other developers as a dependency
- ✅ You find critical security bugs in your own code
- ✅ External researchers report vulnerabilities
- ✅ Your project is public and widely adopted

**Your situation:**
- ⚪ Student report system (internal use)
- ⚪ Not published as npm package
- ⚪ Not used as dependency by others
- ⚪ Personal/educational project

**Recommendation:** Enable **Private Vulnerability Reporting** so researchers can report issues, but you likely won't create advisories unless you find critical bugs.

## 📊 Managing Dependabot Security Updates

### Your Current Setup ✅

**What's already working:**

1. **Dependabot Alerts:** ✅ Enabled
   - Monitors all dependencies
   - Alerts you to known CVEs
   - Currently tracking 4 vulnerabilities

2. **Dependabot Security Updates:** ✅ Enabled
   - Automatically creates PRs for security patches
   - Prioritized over version updates
   - Auto-merge bot handles patch-level security fixes

3. **Auto-Merge Bot:** ✅ Active
   - Automatically merges security patch updates
   - Waits for CI checks
   - Applies fixes within hours (not days)

### Security Update Priority

Your bot handles security updates with **high priority**:

```yaml
# In .github/workflows/auto-merge-dependabot.yml

Security patches (e.g., 1.2.3 → 1.2.4):
→ Auto-merge ✅ (patch level)
→ Applied within minutes after CI passes

Security minors (e.g., 1.2.x → 1.3.0):
→ Auto-merge if devDependency ✅
→ Manual review if production dependency ⚠️

Security majors (e.g., 1.x → 2.0):
→ Always manual review ⚠️
→ Breaking changes require testing
```
