## 🧪 Test Push Protection (Optional)

Want to see it in action? Try this test:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /home/rongrath/Desktop/NextJs/student-report

# Create a test file with fake secret
echo "API_KEY=sk_test_fake123456789abcdef" > test-secret.txt

# Try to commit and push
git add test-secret.txt
git commit -m "Test: Secret scanning"
git push origin main

# Expected Result:
# 🛑 Push blocked by GitHub!
# 
# Secret detected in push:
# - Type: Generic API Key
# - Location: test-secret.txt:1
# 
# Your push was rejected because it contains a secret.
# 
# Options:
# 1. Remove the secret and try again
# 2. Skip protection (not recommended)

# Clean up test
git reset HEAD~1
rm test-secret.txt
```
